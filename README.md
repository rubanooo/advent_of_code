# Advent of Code in Rust

My Advent of Code solutions in the Rust programming language. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn more about Rust, so I'm sure there are many things that could be improved. This repository holds a cargo workspace package for each day.

## Run solutions

Each Rust project contains a **input.txt** file, holding the puzzle input. Simply run the project to see the solution appear. For example:

```bash
cargo run --bin day_1_2022
```
